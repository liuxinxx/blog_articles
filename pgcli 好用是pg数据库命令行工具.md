## A REPL for Postgres

This is a postgres client that does auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

## Quick Start

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:

```
$ pip install -U pgcli

or

$ sudo apt-get install pgcli # Only on Debian based Linux (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, etc)
$ brew install pgcli  # Only on macOS
```

If you don't know how to install python packages, please check the [detailed instructions](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli#detailed-installation-instructions).

If you have [problems with psycopg2 wheels](http://initd.org/psycopg/articles/2018/02/08/psycopg-274-released/), use the following flags to install psycopg2 from source:

```
$ pip install pgcli --no-binary :all: psycopg2
```



## Usage

```
$ pgcli [database_name]

or

$ pgcli postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?extra=value[&other=other-value]]
```

Examples:

```
$ pgcli local_database

$ pgcli postgres://amjith:pa$$w0rd@example.com:5432/app_db?sslmode=verify-ca&sslrootcert=/myrootcert
```



## Features

The pgcli is written using [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit).

- Auto-completes as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables and columns in the database.

- Syntax highlighting using Pygments.

- Smart-completion (enabled by default) will suggest context-sensitive completion.

  > - `SELECT * FROM <tab>` will only show table names.
  > - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>` will only show column names.

- Primitive support for `psql` back-slash commands.

- Pretty prints tabular data.



## Config

A config file is automatically created at `~/.config/pgcli/config` at first launch. See the file itself for a description of all available options.

## Detailed Installation Instructions:



### macOS:

The easiest way to install pgcli is using Homebrew.

```
$ brew install pgcli
```

Done!

Alternatively, you can install `pgcli` as a python package using a package manager called called `pip`. You will need postgres installed on your system for this to work.

In depth getting started guide for `pip` - <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>.

```
$ which pip
```

If it is installed then you can do:

```
$ pip install pgcli
```

If that fails due to permission issues, you might need to run the command with sudo permissions.

```
$ sudo pip install pgcli
```

If pip is not installed check if easy_install is available on the system.

```
$ which easy_install

$ sudo easy_install pgcli
```



### Linux:

In depth getting started guide for `pip` - <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>.

Check if pip is already available in your system.

```
$ which pip
```

If it doesn't exist, use your linux package manager to install pip. This might look something like:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip   # Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc

or

$ sudo yum install python-pip  # RHEL, Centos, Fedora etc
```

`pgcli` requires python-dev, libpq-dev and libevent-dev packages. You can install these via your operating system package manager.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libpq-dev libevent-dev

or

$ sudo yum install python-devel postgresql-devel
```

Then you can install pgcli:

```
$ sudo pip install pgcli
```



### Docker

Pgcli can be run from within Docker. This can be useful to try pgcli without installing it, or any dependencies, system-wide.

To build the image:

```
$ docker build -t pgcli .
```

To create a container from the image:

```
$ docker run --rm -ti pgcli pgcli <ARGS>
```

To access postgresql databases listening on localhost, make sure to run the docker in "host net mode". E.g. to access a database called "foo" on the postgresql server running on localhost:5432 (the standard port):

```
$ docker run --rm -ti --net host pgcli pgcli -h localhost foo
```

To connect to a locally running instance over a unix socket, bind the socket to the docker container:

```
$ docker run --rm -ti -v /var/run/postgres:/var/run/postgres pgcli pgcli foo
```



### IPython

Pgcli can be run from within [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console. When working on a query, it may be useful to drop into a pgcli session without leaving the IPython console, iterate on a query, then quit pgcli to find the query results in your IPython workspace.

Assuming you have IPython installed:

```
$ pip install ipython-sql
```

After that, run ipython and load the `pgcli.magic` extension:

```
$ ipython

In [1]: %load_ext pgcli.magic
```

Connect to a database and construct a query:

```
In [2]: %pgcli postgres://someone@localhost:5432/world
Connected: someone@world
someone@localhost:world> select * from city c where countrycode = 'USA' and population > 1000000;
+------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
| id   | name         | countrycode   | district     | population   |
|------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------|
| 3793 | New York     | USA           | New York     | 8008278      |
| 3794 | Los Angeles  | USA           | California   | 3694820      |
| 3795 | Chicago      | USA           | Illinois     | 2896016      |
| 3796 | Houston      | USA           | Texas        | 1953631      |
| 3797 | Philadelphia | USA           | Pennsylvania | 1517550      |
| 3798 | Phoenix      | USA           | Arizona      | 1321045      |
| 3799 | San Diego    | USA           | California   | 1223400      |
| 3800 | Dallas       | USA           | Texas        | 1188580      |
| 3801 | San Antonio  | USA           | Texas        | 1144646      |
+------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
SELECT 9
Time: 0.003s
```

Exit out of pgcli session with `Ctrl + D` and find the query results:

```
someone@localhost:world>
Goodbye!
9 rows affected.
Out[2]:
[(3793, u'New York', u'USA', u'New York', 8008278),
 (3794, u'Los Angeles', u'USA', u'California', 3694820),
 (3795, u'Chicago', u'USA', u'Illinois', 2896016),
 (3796, u'Houston', u'USA', u'Texas', 1953631),

 (3800, u'Dallas', u'USA', u'Texas', 1188580),
 (3801, u'San Antonio', u'USA', u'Texas', 1144646)]
```

The results are available in special local variable `_`, and can be assigned to a variable of your choice:

```
In [3]: my_result = _
```



## Thanks:

A special thanks to [Jonathan Slenders](https://twitter.com/jonathan_s) for creating [Python Prompt Toolkit](http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit), which is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible. Jonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development of this app.

[Click](http://click.pocoo.org/) is used for command line option parsing and printing error messages.

Thanks to [psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/) for providing a rock solid interface to Postgres database.

Thanks to all the beta testers and contributors for your time and patience. :)
